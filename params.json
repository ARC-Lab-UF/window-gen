The VHDL entity includes configuration options for image sizes, window sizes, data width, number of parallel windows, among others (see documentation). The image and window sizes can also be changed dynamically. Given an input image, the window generator will create a set of output windows that correspond to \"sliding\" the window across the image. This type of operation is common in many signal-processing applications (e.g., convolution). One of the main contributions of this project is support for any number of parallel windows.\r\n\r\nThis project provides the VHDL source code associated with the paper:\r\n\r\n_Greg Stitt, Eric Schwartz, Patrick Cooke.

Although memory bandwidth\r\noften restricts parallelism for many applications, sliding-window applications can leverage custom buffers,\r\nreferred to as sliding-window generators, that provide massive input bandwidth that far exceeds the capa-\r\nbilities of external memory. Previous work has introduced a variety of sliding-window generators, but those\r\napproaches typically generate at most one window per cycle, which significantly restricts parallelism. In this\r\npaper, we address this limitation with a parallel sliding-window generator that can generate a configurable\r\nnumber of windows every cycle. Although in practice the number of parallel windows is limited by memory\r\nbandwidth, we show that even with common bandwidth limitations, the presented generator enables near-\r\nlinear speedups up to 16x faster than previous FPGA studies that generate a single window per cycle, which\r\nwere already in some cases faster than graphics-processing units (GPUs) and microprocessors.\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\nPlease read the corresponding paper for usage instructions.
